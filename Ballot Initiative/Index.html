        <h1>El Pasoans for Fair Elections</h1>
        <p>Thank you for helping us transform our local political system.  We can’t do this without you.  

            In order to get on the ballot, we will need to submit 11,000 signatures to the City Clerk by the end of June.  The City clerk will then validate them.  After that, City Council will get to approve, amend or reject our ballot initiatives (propositions).  We expect they will reject all of them.  Then we will need to gather another 11,000 signatures.  
            
            This is why every single signature matters. 
            
            We must assume that the City Clerk will find ways to invalidate signatures - for example, if people are not registered to vote in El Paso, the handwriting is not legible or corrections are not initialed by the voter who signed.  
            </p>
            <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
            <p>1. Ask the person if they are registered to vote in the City of El Paso.  People who are registered only in the County, cannot sign.</p>
            <p>2. If the person is not sure they are registered check on epcountyvotes.com.</p>
            <p>3. Ask what zipcode they live in before they sign. If it’s anything that’s not 799 then it’s not acceptable, except for 79835. 79928, 08 and 18 are not acceptable </p>
            <p>4. Print their first and last name as clearly as possible.   Please avoid letting them write it themselves since it may not be legible and will get rejected. </p>
            <p>5. Fill out their address, date of birth (DOB: month/day/year).  If they don’t want to give you their DOB, but they know their voter ID number, write the number.  We need one or the other, but we are filling out both to be able to show we have the right number of good signatures. </p>
            <p>6. Ask them for their phone number and email since we will need to do this again and may want to contact them.  People have been eager to help out once they learn how hard this process is.  However, if someone says “no”, it’s ok.  The City Clerk does not require that information.</p>
            <p>7. ASK THEM TO SIGN!!  Use the same pen you used so that the ink is the same color. </p>
            <p>8. If you make a mistake, it’s ok.  
                a. Be sure to ask them to initial the correction OR 
                b. Cross out the line and use the next line and start over.
                </p>
            <p>9. Ask them if they want to collect signatures and if so, give them a sheet and a copy of the ordinance or put them in contact with us. </p>
            <p>10. Once you have time, please add the VUID number, which you can find at epcountyvotes.com (“Am I Registered”) or https://epcountyvotes.com/quick_links/am_i_registered</p>
            <p>11. If you can't find them on VUID, it's ok. We will ask a volunteer to find them on the VAN which has more registered voters on it than the county site. </p>
            <p>12. Print your name and number at the bottom of the sheet. </p>
            <p>13. Return the signed form(s) at the address provided OR contact justiciafronteriza@gmail.com if you would like to drop it off or have us pick it up.  </p>
            <p>14. Congratulate yourself for doing your part to make our city more fair!</p>
            <p>15. Share your work on social media!! But please don’t show any petitions with actual voters’ information.</p>

            <h2>CLIPBOARDS</h2>
            <p>1. If you print the petition form, PLEASE make sure it is not cropped in any way.   We will provide you with 2 different versions. </p>
            <p>2. Your clipboard includes: 
                a. The petition forms, which have the ballot language of all 3 propositions at the top. 
                b. Two copies of the ordinance language for all 3 ballot initiatives.</p>

            <h2>FINDING REGISTERED VOTERS</h2>
            <p>1. Create a list of family members, friends, co-workers and other people you believe are registered in the City.   NOTE:  Be sure to get your employers’ permission if you collect signatures at work. </p>
            <p>2. Think about organizations you are a part of where you interact with like-minded people, like book clubs, cycling clubs, etc. </p>
            <p>3. Attend public events!</p>

If you’ve read the book, “Who Rules El Paso?” or taken a look at the finance reports of our elected city leaders, you know that a handful of wealthy El Pasoans control local politics.

                <p data-aos="zoom-out-up" data-aos-easing="linear" data-aos-duration="1000">Establishes public financing for candidates for mayor and city council who voluntarily agree to limit their campaign contributions and expenditures and demonstrate community support for their candidacy. Cities like Albuquerque have seen an increase in progressive candidates getting elected to office due to public financing programs. In our proposed program, candidates must submit signatures of support from 1% of the registered voters and must also commit to voluntarily limiting their overall campaign contributions and expenditures. This proposition will help community candidates run without the pressure of caving into big money interests to fund their campaigns. </p>

            <p data-aos="zoom-out-up" data-aos-easing="linear" data-aos-duration="1000">Would eliminate the need for runoff elections for mayor and city council by using ranked choice voting where voters rank candidates in order of preference, and if no candidate receives a majority, candidates with the fewest votes are eliminated and the votes they received are transferred to voter’s second choice, and so on until there is a majority vote for one candidate.  Austin voters passed ranked choice voting through a ballot initiative and other cities are considering it as well.  No Texas city has yet to implement it and we would love for El Paso to be the first to do so.  Rank choice voting could help us save money by avoiding runoff elections that tend to have very low turnout rates and would also give voters the option of ranking candidates they may like but may fear are not “viable.” </p>

Andrew Allison, founder of More Perfect Texas, has guided us from the beginning and had this to say about our work:
            “Each day since our grant, Justicia Fronteriza has further affirmed that their organization has the values, integrity, thoughtfulness, and competence that not only increase the probability of their success in November but also ensure that they will set the bar for what an effective progressive campaign looks like.”  - Andrew Allison, Founder, More Perfect Texas
            More Perfect Texas has provided $83,000 to support our ballot initiative.  We are very grateful for their donation and are pursuing other grants. If you would like to donate to El Pasoans for Fair Elections campaign</p> -->
